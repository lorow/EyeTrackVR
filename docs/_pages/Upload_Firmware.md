# Building and uploading the firmware

Uploading your firmware must initially be done over cable. Once you have the tracker connected to your WiFi after your first firmware update, you can opt to use OTA in the future.

## 1. Connect your tracker to your PC

First, connect your esp32cam to your programmer. In case of the esp32-cam-mb board, it's as simple as sticking it into the socket the way it came in the package and then connecting it your PC with an micro-usb cable.

In case of an FTDI programmer, the steps aren't as easy, so grab [this guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/program-upload-code-esp32-cam/) for how to set it up.

## 2. Build your firmware

1. Press the build button at the bottom of Visual Studio Code.

## 3. Upload your firmware

- If you are using the OTA method, first make sure the tracker you wish to flash is turned on.

- Once the firmware has been built, press the upload button to upload the firmware.

**NOTE** The MB board does the resetting for you, so if you're suing the FTDI programmer, follow the guide linked above (the one from randomnerdtutorials)

- If the upload is successful, you should get an output that looks like this:

Congratulations! You have now successfully uploaded the firmware to your EyeTrackVR Tracker!

If you have trouble with uploading your firmware over cable check the following:

1. Make sure your USB cable from the tracker is plugged firmly into your PC.
2. Make sure that your USB cable is a data and charging cable (it is suggested you try other cables or devices with the cable).
3. Make sure that your drivers are up-to-date.
4. Some ports might not work, try other ones.

Additionally, this can be caused by software hogging COM ports (**VSCode and Cura can be the cause of this**).

## Uploading via OTA

Once you have successfully connected your trackers to your WiFi, you can use OTA to handle all future firmware updates.

1. Retrieve the IP of the tracker you wish to flash. The IP can be found through network monitoring applications, or by viewing tracker output in a serial monitor.
2. In `platformio.ini` file uncomment the following lines in Visual Studio Code by removing the `;`:

```ini
;upload_protocol = espota
;upload_port = 192.168.1.49

```
1. Change the value of upload_port to the IP address retrieved during the first step.
1. Turn the tracker you wish to flash off and then on again.
1. Wait around 5 seconds.
1. Press the upload button to upload the firmware.<br>

1. Repeat for as many trackers as you need.
